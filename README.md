# RamosTech

Welcome to my corner of GitHub. Most of what you’ll find here are projects that explore code, methods, and the quirks of macOS. Some of these tools may be useful in practice, but many are experiments—ways to test boundaries, uncover limitations, and refine approaches to automation and system management.

## About Me

I work primarily in the Apple ecosystem, with a focus on scripting, automation, and enterprise workflows. My background includes:
- Building reusable diagnostic scripts and automation for macOS environments
- Exploring secure workflow design, encryption, and device management
- Experimenting with GMRS radio programming and other technical hobbies
- Writing clear, audience‑focused documentation to make complex systems approachable

I approach projects as opportunities to learn, test, and share— not to show off. This space reflects curiosity more than polished products.

## Projects

Here’s what you’ll typically see in my repositories:
- **Exploratory scripts**: Bash, Swift, and Python snippets that probe macOS behaviors or streamline admin tasks.
- **Automation experiments**: Workflows that integrate with tools like Jamf Pro, SentinelOne, or clipboard managers.
- **Text utilities**: Methods for cleaning, formatting, and standardizing documentation.
- **Radio programming configs**: GMRS setups for local networks, often shared for reference.
- **Conceptual prototypes**: Early scaffolds for larger ideas, like plugin systems or orchestration layers.

Each project is documented with enough context to be useful, but the emphasis is on exploration rather than production‑ready polish.

## Philosophy

- **Clarity first**: Code and documentation should be understandable by others (and my future self).
- **Experimentation matters**: Even half‑finished ideas can reveal valuable insights.
- **Transparency**: Sharing both successes and limitations helps others learn alongside me.

## Closing Note

If you find something here useful, that’s great. If not, I hope it at least sparks an idea or helps you avoid a pitfall I’ve already stumbled into. These projects are a record of exploration, and I’m glad to share them.
